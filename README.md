## Retailer Support
Currently, our product supports AliExpress only. We have decided to launch our initial release using a single retailer, and add the rest of the stores shortly after based on users’ feedbacks and demands. The following stores are planned to be added:

- Amazon
- Walmart
- Costco
- HomeDepot
- Lowe’s
- JingDong
- Vip.com
- Gearbest

If the support for any store is added, you will automatically have full access to it after updating the plugin.

Please note that stores in the above list might change or be removed altogether. We’re working hard to prove them shortly, but there’s a small chance that the list would change.
